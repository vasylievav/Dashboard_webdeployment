This is a web dashboard for comparing client-base JS frameworks. The Dashboard makes intervaled API requests (every 2 seconds) to GITHUB APIs of each framework. In order to add or remove a framework from Dashboard, you ll need to add an API adress to framework list in framework_list.js

User is also able to sort on UI in asc and desc order (and return to default order) in order to compare frameworks.
