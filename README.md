This is a web dashboard for comparing client-base JS frameworks. The Dashboard makes intervaled API requests (every 2 seconds) to GITHUB APIs of each framework. 
In order to add or remove a framework from Dashboard, API adress needs to be added to framework_list.js.
In order to add another comparison attribute , comparison_attributes_list.js needs to be updated.

User is also able to sort on UI in asc (1 click on header), desc (2-d click) order and return to default order (3-d click) in order to compare frameworks.
